# WHAT IS THE PROJECT ABOUT?
Nowadays, the vast majority of transit of goods is done via pallets. They are easy to use, reuse and come in standard sizes. But as they are made of wood and degrade over time, they can be a real threat to warehouses, especially automated ones. 
Thatâ€™s why every warehouse is equipped with a PIE (or Product Inspection Entry). Its main purpose is to determine whether the pallet (and merchandise) meets the required conditions in order to be stocked. It is crucial to discard defective pallets, especially in automated warehouses, as they can have huge consequences from losing merchandise to a total warehouse blockage.

The objective of this project is to detect the defects a palet can have using 3D cameras. In order to do so, we will use the intel realsense D435i and the matlab code in this folder. 

> [!NOTE]
> This project is currently at early stage. Each team member is working on some parts which will then be assembled into one general folder for each functionnality the system must have.
