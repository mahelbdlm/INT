# edge_detection
This code tries to detect the pallet. This will be especially useful to identify whether the palet has a missing / not aligned splinter, or not. 

## Step by step explanation of the code

### DETECTION OF THE LARGEST STRAIGHT LINE
| Function  | Description | Image result |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ```[frame,depth,color] = frame.get_frame_at_index(120);```  | Returns the ```color``` image (120th frame of _missing_splinter1_) |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21461776-19b6-40e7-b56a-3f44b03a6fb0)|
| ```grayImg = rgb2gray(color);```  | Convert RGB image to gray | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df7ca9f8-e8c8-428f-91ab-0c5f3ed7efe1 ) |
| ```grayImg = rgb2gray(color);```  | Convert RGB image to gray | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df7ca9f8-e8c8-428f-91ab-0c5f3ed7efe1 ) |
| ```bwImg = imbinarize(grayImg, 'adaptive', 'Sensitivity', 0.5);```  | Convert image to a 1/0 image for edge detection |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a298ee0-b0b5-445d-ad92-93954aa7399c)|
| ```bwFilled = imfill(bwImg, 'holes');```  | Fill holes (0's) by 1's |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6770dc7-05a9-4167-ae0b-af60c918a79e)|
| ```edges = edge(bwFilled, 'canny');```  | Uses canny edge detection algorithm |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff6ac517-c8bf-4611-b558-f44a0a6f6b1a)|
| ```[H,T,R]=hough(edges);```  | Perform a Hough transformation on the binary file to identify straight lines ||
| ``` P  = houghpeaks(H,1,'threshold',ceil(0.3*max(H(:))));```<br/><br/>```lines = houghlines(bwFilled,T,R,P,'FillGap',5,'MinLength',7);```  | We are only identifying one peak with a value of at least 0.3 times the highest value of the map.<br/>Then, we exctract the lines from this peak.<br/> If two lines have a separation of less than 5, they merge into one line.<br/>The minimum length for a line to be considered is 7. |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c9871b2-df31-4a6e-9a7a-7a95f4611407)|


#### More information about houghPeak and houghLine
Depending on the values of the number of peaks, threshold, fillGap and minLength, the results can vary greatly. 
To illustrate this, the following parameters have been set on the same image. 
It can be observed that finding the correct value is crucial in order to have a good result, as much as having a good quality image.
> [!NOTE]
> The number of lines is not equal to the number of peaks. One peak can highlight different lines.


| Function  | Image result |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ``` houghpeaks(H,1,'threshold',ceil(0.3*max(H(:))));```<br/><br/>```houghlines(bwFilled,T,R,P,'FillGap',1,'MinLength',7);``` |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/826a3457-7028-408a-afca-c0fbd3bd3486)|
| ``` houghpeaks(H,1,'threshold',ceil(0.3*max(H(:))));```<br/><br/>```houghlines(bwFilled,T,R,P,'FillGap',10,'MinLength',7);```<br/><br/>We are now increasing the value of the gap for two lines to merge |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cf31c08-b408-41ca-b20b-8bfadeabcd0a)|
| ``` houghpeaks(H,10,'threshold',ceil(0.3*max(H(:))));```<br/><br/>```houghlines(bwFilled,T,R,P,'FillGap',10,'MinLength',7);```<br/><br/>We are now finding 10 peaks|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e18393-e0c5-4f14-9f3d-57c0f359ba20)|
| ``` houghpeaks(H,10,'threshold',ceil(0.8*max(H(:))));```<br/><br/>```houghlines(bwFilled,T,R,P,'FillGap',10,'MinLength',7);```<br/><br/>We are now finding 10 peaks with threshold 0.8<br/>Note how the lines are now larger, this is because the higher<br/> the value of the peak, the larger the line |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0493c1c7-160a-45fe-81b8-b0e50ff9316f)|
| ``` houghpeaks(H,10,'threshold',ceil(0.8*max(H(:))));```<br/><br/>```houghlines(bwFilled,T,R,P,'FillGap',10,'MinLength',50);```<br/><br/>Now, only lines larger than 50 are shown.<br/>Note that this reduces greatly the numbe of results.<br/>We must take care with this value, as our line is not perfect,<br/> and thus we won't be able to select very large lines to detect the pallet. |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5115b525-9f7c-4921-9fc1-15a616d70db7)|

### ROTATE, RESIZE IMAGE
| Function  | Description | Image result |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ```I=imrotate(color,90+lines(1).theta);```  | Rotate the image to be vertical on the straight line obtained before |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc5ee079-97f4-4e0c-a237-3bd5f3b3d74b)|
<!--| ```if mod(lines(1).theta, 90) - 45 < 0```<br/>```    hcrop = find(I(:,3) > 0, 1);```<br/>```    wcrop = length(I(1,:)) - find(I(3, end:-1:1) > 0, 1);```<br/>```end```<br/>```if mod(lines(1).theta, 90) - 45 > 0```<br/>```    hcrop = find(I(end:-1:1,3) > 0, 1);```<br/>```    wcrop = length(I(1,:)) - find(I(3,:) > 0, 1);```<br/>```end```<br/>```I = I(hcrop:end-hcrop, end-wcrop:wcrop);```  |  The image I is cropped to focus on the relevant portion<br/><br/>Depending on the orientation of the detected line (angle relative to 90Â°), the code calculates cropping indices hcrop (for height) and wcrop (for width). It uses pixel intensity checks ```find(I(:,3) > 0, 1)``` to determine the cropping regions.  |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0158e606-c0e6-471d-8fa3-1eb8c17d8d0b)|
| ```Iscaled = uint8(255 * double(I) ./ double(max(I(:))));```<br/>```rgbI = repmat(Iscaled, 1, 1, 3);```  | Create an grayscale image for each RGB channel (red, blue, green) |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/182a379f-aa6d-4a2d-9199-b0afa084fcdf)|
