# PALET_SIDE
This folder contains .mat files of different palets taken from a bit below the palet (considering chains).

Upon reviewing the footage, the following conclusions have been made: 
1. This footage is currently worse than the one we did with the lights of the laboratory
2. One critical part is the removal of background. To do this, a green background could be applied (or any color which would have high contrast ratio)
    * This issue can be adressed by cropping the image (as we need more width than height), but the contrast between the palet and the background has to remain high

This problem can be seen in the following picture, where it is difficult to distinguish the palet from the gray doors, and overall background.
